# Logistic-Regression_Predicte-modeling-for-agriculture

**Description** 

This project leverages scikit-learn and Logistic Regresson modeling to build a multi-class classification model and predict an optimal crop based on the following features:

"N": Nitrogen content ratio in the soil
"P": Phosphorous content ratio in the soil
"K": Potassium content ratio in the soil
"pH": value of the soil

A F1 score is used to measure model's performance, aiming to achieve accuracy greater than 0.5.
